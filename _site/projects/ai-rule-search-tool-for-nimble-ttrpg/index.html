    <h1>Nimble TTRPG AI Rule Reference Tool</h1>
<h2>The Final (for now) Result</h2>
<p>I built a <strong>hosted searchable web app</strong> that uses Python and Flask to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ingest and chunk PDFs</li>
<li>Run fast keyword and fuzzy searches</li>
<li>Display results in an easy-to-read web UI</li>
<li>Highlight relevant matches</li>
<li>Provide citation-style links back to the original PDF section</li>
</ul>
<p>It‚Äôs not a full chatbot or vector-powered retrieval system‚Äîit's <strong>deliberately simpler and faster</strong>. I wanted something my group could use on the fly during sessions, with no money down.</p>
<p>Hosted on Render: <a href="https://nimble-rules.onrender.com/search">Nimble Rules Search</a></p>
<p>Give it a bit to spin up! Then use password: Hopscotch</p>
<h2>What I Set Out to Build</h2>
<p>So with my long-running online TTRPG group, we play using a game system that's pretty new called Nimble. Unlike other Table-Top Role Playing Games like Dungeons and Dragons, there aren't many tools or references made for this one. Since we are all learning the system together, I wanted an easy way to <strong>look up specific rules from the Nimble rules PDFs during gameplay</strong>‚Äîwithout constantly flipping through 100-page rulebooks or opening the different files and wondering which ones my answer would be in. I also wanted to make it lightweight, private for just my group's use, and <strong>hostable for free</strong>, without needing to train an expensive AI model or rely on external APIs.</p>
<h2>Options I Explored (and Why I Didn‚Äôt Use Them)</h2>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Tool/Option</th>
<th>Why I Looked at It</th>
<th>Why I Didn‚Äôt Use It</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>ChatGPT API</td>
<td>Natural language support</td>
<td>$$$ and not self-hosted</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>GPT4All</td>
<td>Local LLM inference</td>
<td>Too heavy for this use case</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Pinecone/Weaviate</td>
<td>Vector DB for semantic search</td>
<td>Overkill for keyword-based queries</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>LangChain</td>
<td>Full retrieval pipeline</td>
<td>Added too much complexity</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>ChatPDF / PDF.ai</td>
<td>Fast for individuals</td>
<td>Not private or customizable or free</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>I realized I didn't actually need natural language processing‚Äî<strong>keyword and fuzzy matching was enough</strong>. The goal wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúconversational,‚Äù just <strong>fast, accurate rule recall</strong>. I might expand on this in the future, but as a starting tool, I wanted to simplify my goal here.</p>
<h2>Tools and Tech Used</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Python</strong> (core script + backend logic)</li>
<li><strong>Flask</strong> (lightweight web server)</li>
<li><strong>PyMuPDF</strong> (<code>fitz</code>) for PDF parsing</li>
<li><strong>FuzzyWuzzy</strong> (for fuzzy matching)</li>
<li><strong>HTML/CSS</strong> (basic templating)</li>
<li><strong>VS Code</strong> for development</li>
<li><strong>Render.com</strong> (free tier deployment)</li>
<li><strong>ChatGPT</strong> for vibe coding and learning</li>
</ul>
<h2>What I Learned</h2>
<p>This was one of my first practical experiments applying lightweight AI techniques for personal use. I learned a ton about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keeping scope tight</li>
<li>Deploying apps (I had never uploaded to GitHub before!)</li>
<li>Creating a front-end interface</li>
<li>Chunking and adjusting weighting</li>
<li>NLPs in general, what's out there and what they can do</li>
</ul>
<h2>Updates I'm Considering</h2>
<p>I might like to update this project with features like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Natural Language Processing for search</li>
<li>A streamlined way to upload new PDF versions</li>
<li>A &quot;clear search&quot; option</li>
<li>A front-end that's actually designed</li>
<li>Obviously Nimble won't be happy to give their PDFs away for free via my search tool; I wonder if I can figure out a way to make it a searchable tool anyone beyond my group can use but not put their IP at risk?</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Have you built something similar? How did you do it differently? Whether it's another PDF reference tool or just another tool for a TTRPG like Nimble, I'd be super curious to take a peek and learn what worked for you!</p>
