    <h1>Planting the first seed</h1>
<p>Welcome to the beginning of <strong>Questadon</strong>, my little plot of cloud-soil where Iâ€™ll be documenting what I learn, make, and experiment with. A place where I can try things out, document the weird and wonderful bits of the process, and hopefully connect with others doing the same.</p>
<p>My goal is simple: <strong>use this site as a no-budget learning project where I house my other learning and creative projects!</strong> I'm hoping to build things that are thoughtful, fast, and sustainable. And end up with stuff that I actually personally use!</p>
<h2>Why Iâ€™m doing this</h2>
<p>So, I'm primarily a designer and marketer; Iâ€™ve been creating websites for years (2008, yikes) using platforms like Webflow. I had never been really interested in the nuts and bolts of programming, but hello 2025 and crazy-times-in-the-world, suddenly I find myself feeling a lot more digital-DIY-inclined.</p>
<p>I want the things I make to reflect how I work and what I value. That means:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keeping things <strong>lean and performant</strong> (small page sizes, optimized images, reasonable JS, eventually light/dark mode)</li>
<li>Building on other people's workâ€”no need to reinvent the wheel for the sake of it, use what's already out there and put it together in new ways that work for me</li>
<li>Crediting the amazing people, tools, and small companies I learn from along the way</li>
</ul>
<p>The core constraints:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>No money down</strong></li>
<li><strong>Environmentally mindful</strong></li>
<li><strong>Learning-focused above all</strong></li>
<li><strong>Make stuff I want!</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Y'all, I don't know what I'm doing here. If you're doing something similar, say hi! Seeing people working on stuff that makes the digital world safer, more environmentally-sustainable, more accessible to all, and better for humans in generalâ€”that stuff gives me hope.</p>
<h2>My starting point</h2>
<p>Where am I starting from? I'm relatively familiar with HTML and CSS, and Iâ€™ve just taken my first dip into Python and JavaScript. My learning will be assisted by AI, I'm gonna vibe-code my way through a lot of this (yep, really inviting the hate from that comment), but as I immerse myself in these projects I'll be looking to learn from other sources as well.</p>
<p>I'm starting with just building this website, though I have a couple other projects already in progress. What I've done so far:</p>
<ul>
<li>Picked <strong>Obsidian</strong> to track my learning and outline content</li>
<li>Chose <strong>11ty</strong> as my static site generator for this website</li>
<li>Planned a <strong>Dev Garden</strong> (posts like this, built as a learn-in-public journal)</li>
<li>Consolidated some <strong>Projects</strong> I've already been working onâ€”builds, experiments, useful tools</li>
</ul>
<p>This is only the beginningâ€”but Iâ€™m already learning a lot. And thatâ€™s kind of the whole point.</p>
<p>Letâ€™s see where this takes me.</p>
