    <h1>Rebranding Word Documents to Use a New Branded Template (A First Attempt at python-docx and docx2python)</h1>
<p>I made this because I had 160 articles to rebrand for work, and figured I'd make a personal project of it. But gosh, this pushed way beyond what I've worked with before.</p>
<p>The goal was to reformat old .docx articles into a clean new branded style using a Word template, all as a batch.</p>
<p>I learned about the python-docx library, low-level XML manipulation, and building structured content transformation pipelines... this was all super new for me and probably more advanced than I SHOULD have gone at my current level. But hey, pretty in character for me to throw myself into the deep end and try not to drown. ;)</p>
<p>I've got a parser.py to detect elements of the old docs and a writer.py to create the new docs, and a convert.py for single file tests and convert_batch.py for all 160 (no limit I'm aware of?).</p>
<p>Here's the <a href="https://github.com/sae-br/Article-Rebrand">GitHub folder</a></p>
<h2><strong>Libraries and Tools I Used</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>python-docx</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://pypi.org/project/python-docx/">Documentation</a>
<a href="https://pypi.org/user/scanny/">Many thanks to Scanny!</a></p>
<p>I used this library to read and write Word .docx files. Most of the document structure work happened with this.</p>
<p>Key things I worked with:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Document(...)</code> ‚Äì to create or load a .docx</li>
<li><code>.add_paragraph()</code> and <code>.add_run()</code> ‚Äì to insert styled text</li>
<li><code>.add_table()</code> ‚Äì to generate and format tables</li>
<li><code>.paragraphs[0]._element.getparent().remove(...)</code> ‚Äì this was used to delete placeholder content from my Word template</li>
</ul>
<p>There were a few things I wanted to do that python-docx can‚Äôt handle out of the box‚Äîlike clickable hyperlinks, table cell borders, and padding. So I dropped down into the WordprocessingML XML layer, which I still don't think I quite understand yet, to be honest.</p>
<p>Key functions and objects:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>OxmlElement(...)</code> ‚Äì to create custom XML tags like <code>&lt;w:hyperlink&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;w:r&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;w:tcBorders&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>parse_xml(...)</code> ‚Äì to convert a raw XML string into an element</li>
<li><code>qn(...)</code> ‚Äì to apply the correct namespace prefix to tags</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>docx2python</strong></h3>
<p><a href="https://pypi.org/project/docx2python/">Documentation</a>
<a href="https://pypi.org/user/ShayHill/">Many thanks to ShayHill!</a></p>
<p>Used only for extracting the title text from textboxes, since python-docx can‚Äôt read headers or textboxes very well.</p>
<p>This was a good learning stretch for me and helped me understand how Word documents are really structured under the hood.</p>
<h2><strong>Design Elements My Article Rebrander Can (and Can't) Handle</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Paragraph Types</strong></h3>
<p>The parser detects these block types:</p>
<ul>
<li>heading2, heading3</li>
<li>paragraph</li>
<li>list_item (used for both bulleted and numbered lists for now)</li>
<li>table</li>
</ul>
<p>Each type is output with the correct style name from my template (like ‚ÄúBody Text‚Äù, ‚ÄúList Paragraph‚Äù, etc). This gave me full control over the final formatting.</p>
<h3><strong>Lists</strong></h3>
<p>Unordered and ordered list detection was trickier than expected. I spent like 2 hours trying things that kept not working for the ordered lists.</p>
<p>For now, I settled on treating all list items as list_item, and styled them uniformly as unordered lists. Hyperlinked text inside list items is also supported.</p>
<p>Partial win here.</p>
<h3><strong>Tables</strong></h3>
<p>Tables are generated row by row, and for each cell:</p>
<ul>
<li>Borders are added (light grey)</li>
<li>Internal margins/padding are applied</li>
<li>Text formatting (bold, italic, underline) is preserved</li>
</ul>
<p>This only works for simple tables. For example merged cells, column widths, and specific table formatting isn't preserved.</p>
<p>Another partial win!</p>
<h2><strong>Things I'm Learning as a Programming Noob</strong></h2>
<p>This project helped me:</p>
<ul>
<li>Understand how to use python-docx for both reading and writing Word content</li>
<li>Dive into XML-based formatting using OxmlElement</li>
<li>Improve my ability to modularize code and handle complex document structures</li>
<li>Debug layout issues that didn‚Äôt come from syntax errors but from subtle Word styling quirks</li>
</ul>
<p>I encountered some small pieces for the first time as well:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wrote my first README.md file</li>
<li>Learned what a .gitignore is and used one</li>
<li>I didn't realize you can't comment in a JSON file, but now I know!</li>
<li>I <strong>tested out GitHub Copilots and to be honest, it wasn't a win for me.</strong> It misunderstood my instructions and gave incorrect responses for almost all the things I wanted it to do, so I fell back on my good faithful non-optimal ChatGPT. Which sent me in circles on the ordered list issue for a long time but helped me find the libraries, figure out how to implement them, and get to where I got with this!</li>
</ul>
<p>This was a stretch project for me and a rewarding one‚ÄîI built something genuinely useful, and got much better at handling real-world Python code in the process.</p>
<p>I don't know if I SAVED myself time on converting those articles, ha, but I learned a heck of a lot more than I would have by monotonously doing them all manually one by one.</p>
