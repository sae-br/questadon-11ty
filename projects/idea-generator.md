# Random Project Idea Generator

## The Final Result

My very first JavaScript learning project started as a quote generator with a button. But then I turned it into something more fun and "me"‚Äîa **random project idea machine** that combines three elements to generate prompts like:

> ‚ÄúAn alarm system for small business owners preparing for the end times.‚Äù

Each time you click the button, a new combination is generated from three curated lists. I also integrated it cleanly into my [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) site, styled it, and added logic to avoid repeat results.

You can see it live **at the bottom of my homepage!** Give it a whirl!

## What I Set Out to Build

Initially I just wanted to practice:
- Writing basic JavaScript functions
- Selecting elements with `getElementById`
- Using event listeners
- Randomizing items from an array

So I started by creating a basic quote generator that displayed a random inspirational quote from an array. 

I used [this article tutorial for a random quote generator](https://medium.com/@nambilucia/lets-build-a-simple-random-quote-generator-in-vanilla-js-50b13fcd9c39) to get me started, because it was recent and uses vanilla javascript. Thanks Lucia Nambi! üôå

I went through all the code and had AI walk me through the concepts used (and it assigned me a bunch of practices for converting traditional functions to arrow functions, because I was really getting stuck on that.)

Once I understood how this separate little app worked on its own, I wanted to integrate it into my site and make it more "me".

I'm not much of a quote person. So I was like, what if instead it was an idea generator? 

And I figured from what I had learned about `Math.floor(Math.random() * quotes.length)` there had to be a way to do this for three sets of information and then just display them all as a single string.

There was. Yay!

## How I Built It

- I created three separate arrays (`ideas1`, `ideas2`, `ideas3`)
- I used a single function (`getRandomItem`) to select a random item from each
- I displayed the full result using `innerHTML`
- I added a reusable function to **avoid repeating the same value twice in a row**

Once it worked in a standalone folder, I:
- Created a Nunjucks partial (`quote-box.njk`)
- Inserted it as an include on my Eleventy homepage
- Moved the script into `/assets/quote.js`
- Styled it using scoped class names (`.quote-section`, `.quote-output`, etc.)
- Tweaked line widths with `max-width: 30ch` for better multi-line balance

## What I Learned About JavaScript

This project taught me a lot about:
- DOM manipulation (`document.getElementById`, `innerHTML`)
- Array use cases (especially selecting random items)
- Arrow functions vs. traditional functions
- Anonymous functions and callbacks
- The difference between `console.log()` (for developers) vs. DOM updates (for users)
- How to avoid immediate repeats with index tracking
- Writing helper functions

I also got more comfortable with:
- Structuring reusable components for static sites
- Separating concerns: logic in JS, layout in HTML, style in CSS
