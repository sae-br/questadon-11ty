# About

Hi, I’m Sarah Brown—part designer, part marketer, part compulsive learner. I’ve spent nearly 20 years designing websites and leading brand and content strategy, but I started this project to deepen my technical fluency—especially in the kinds of tools and processes developers use every day.

Questadon is site that will intentionally be slow-growing. I’m building it in public, with transparency and gratitude, as I explore static site generators, AI tooling, custom workflows, and sustainable web practices. It’s equal parts learning lab, personal archive, and portfolio of experiments—ranging from storytelling tools for TTRPGs to SEO workflows and automation hacks. 

If you’re working on something similar, or want to trade ideas about slow building, thoughtful tech, or solo digital projects, I’d love to connect.
