# About

Hi, I’m Sarah Brown—part designer, part marketer, part compulsive learner. I’ve spent nearly 20 years designing websites and leading brand and content strategy, but I started Questadon in 2025 shortly after beginning my dive into learning to code. I learn best by doing things out in the wild.

Questadon is a place to track some of my experiments and share some of the things I make along the way with whoever wanders by. On the dev end, I explore static site generators, AI tooling, custom workflows, Django, sustainable web practices, and more. As an avid player and game master of table top role playing games, one of the things I love about the community is how freely people share what they've made—I've definitely benefitted from this, and hope to give back a bit as I move forward! 

If you’re working on similar stuff, or want to trade ideas, don't be a stranger, drop me a note! 

## Stuff I'm Interested In
